# Conway’s Game of Lif
## Khaled Arnaout
### Monmouth College - COMP-210
#### This Project is done as an assignment for school in Spring 2016

This project is able to do the following 
• Maximize population size while maintaining a playable game.
• Players are able to stop and start the game whenever they
like.
• While the game is stopped, players are not able to modify the
current population of cells.
• While the game is going, the game displays the number of
iterations since the last stop or since the last player intervention
with the population. So, if the player stops and starts the game
without killing or resurrecting any cells, then the count should not
change.
• Add Random populations.
• Zooming in and out is still under developing
